    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello! I'm G. Hemalatha, a passionate and determined B.Tech student specializing in Computer Science and Engineering at Madanapalle Institute of Technology and Sciences (MITS).

My academic journey began at Vailankanni Matha Vidyalaya, where I completed my 10th grade with a strong foundation in science and mathematics. I continued my intermediate education at LRG Naidu Junior College, where I developed a deeper interest in technology and problem-solving.

I have honed my skills in programming languages such as C, Java, and Python, and I have a solid understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms. I enjoy logical thinking and love building efficient, optimized solutions.

To enhance my practical knowledge, I am currently pursuing a Web Development Internship at ApexPlanet Software Pvt. Ltd., where I’m working on real-time projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This hands-on experience has improved my ability to build responsive and interactive websites.

I’ve also actively participated in technical workshops and webinars, staying updated with the latest trends in technology and software development.

I consider myself a quick learner, a problem-solver, and someone who is always eager to learn and grow. My goal is to contribute meaningfully to the tech industry through innovation, creativity, and collaboration.

</p>
    <p>This internship helped me build real-world web applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I developed responsive pages, implemented JavaScript interactivity, and learned about GitHub and project hosting.</p>
